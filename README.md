## Summary
Fit lit is an interactive dashboard for users to see their latest sleep data, hydration data, and activity data.
## How it Works
- The site works as a hub for User wellness Data.

- Access data related to sleep, hydration, and activity via the buttons and be taken to informative pages featuring charts explaining the data.
- User Data is stored in a final tab for easy access


## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- API Fetch Calls
- Webpack
- Mocha/Chai
- Chart.js

## Goals and Objectives
- Follow [project rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/fitlit.html) to make a working application. 
- Implement TDD with all classes and methods created.
- Use ES6. 
- Use object and array prototypes to manipulate data needed.
- Create a clear data dashboard.
- Create charts for users to see their data over the week. 

## Challenges
- Chart.js was a new npm package we had to learn. 
- Building correct class structure that works.
- Finding time to do CSS.

1. Clone this repo - on the top right corner of this page, click the **Code** button and copy the link into your terminal. `git clone git@github.com:darlaevans2000/fitlit.git`
2. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
3. Open a new tab in your terminal and clone down the api `git clone git@github.com:turingschool-examples/fitlit-api.git`
4. In the new tab cd into the api and do `npm i` and then `npm start` to start the api.
5. Go back to your first tab in your terminal and run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page on `http://localhost:8080/` 

## Future Additions
